 * TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl.
 * And it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.
 * Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service.
 * There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work.
 * You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
